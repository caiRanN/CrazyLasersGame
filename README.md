# Uncovering Playful Interaction

## About the project
Crazy Lasers is a game created in 8 days during a seminar at the HKU expertise centre. It combines world interaction with motion capture and VR. The game requires two players, one player has to equip a motion capture suit, the other puts on the GearVR. The player with the GearVR has to guide the player with the motion capture suit through an invisible laser maze, the player with the motion capture suit has to follow the instructions and talk with the VR player to navigate to real world buttons to open doors. They can win the game by reaching the end of the maze.
